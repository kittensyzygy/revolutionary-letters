            <p>I have no other</p>
            <p>ransom money, nothing to break or barter but my life</p>
            <p>my spirit measured out, in bits, spread over</p>
            <p>the roulette table, I recoup what I can</p>
            <p>nothing else to shove under the nose of the <i>maitre de jeu</i></p>
            <p>nothing to thrust out the window, no white flag</p>
            <p>this flesh all I have to offer, to make the play with</p>
            <p>this immediate head, what it comes up with, my move</p>
            <p>as we slither over this go board, stepping always</p>
            <p>(we hope) between the lines</p>

            <p>The value of an individual life a credo they taught us</p>
            <p>to instil fear, and inaction, 'you only live once'</p>
            <p>a fog in our eyes, we are</p>
            <p>endless as the sea, not separate, we die</p>
            <p>a million times a day, we are born</p>
            <p>a million times, each breath life and death:</p>
            <p>get up, put on your shoes, get</p>
            <p>started, someone will finish</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Tribe</p>
            <p>an organism, one flesh, breathing joy as the stars</p>
            <p>breathe destiny down on us, get</p>
            <p>going, join hands, see to business, thousands of sons</p>
            <p>will see to it when you fall, you will grow</p>

            <p>store water; make a point of filling your bathtub</p>
            <p>at the first news of trouble: they turned off the water</p>
            <p>in the 4th ward for a whole day during the Newark riots;</p>
            <p>or better yet make a habit</p>
            <p>of keeping the tub clean and full when not in use</p>
            <p>change this once a day, it should be good enough</p>
            <p>for washing, flushing toilets when necessary</p>
            <p>and cooking, in a pinch, but it's a good idea</p>
            <p>to keep some bottled water handy too</p>
            <p>get a couple of five gallon jugs and keep them full</p>
            <p>for cooking</p>
            <br/>
            <p>store food — dry stuff like rice and beans stores best</p>
            <p>goes farthest. SALT VERY IMPORTANT: it's health and energy</p>
            <p>healing too, keep a couple pounds</p>
            <p>sea salt around, and, because we're spoiled, some tins</p>
            <p>tuna, etc. to keep up morale — keep up the sense</p>
            <p>of 'balanced diet' 'protein intake' remember</p>
            <p>the stores may be closed for quite some time, the trucks</p>
            <p>may not enter your section of the city for weeks, you can cool it indefinitely</p>
            <br/>
            <p>with 20 lb brown rice</p>
                    <p class="fivechin">20 lb whole wheat flour</p>
                    <p class="fivechin">10 lb cornmeal</p>
                    <p class="fivechin">10 lb good beans — kidney or soy</p>
                    <p class="fivechin">5 lb sea salt</p>
                    <p class="fivechin">2 qts good oil</p>
            <p>dried fruit and nuts</p>
            <p>add nutrients and a sense of luxury</p>
            <p>to this diet, a squash or coconut</p>
            <p>in a cool place in your pad will keep six months.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>remember we are all used to eating less</p>
            <p>than the 'average American' and take it easy</p>
            <p>before we</p>
            <p>ever notice we're hungry the rest of the folk will be starving</p>
            <p>used as they are to meat and fresh milk daily</p>
            <p>and help will arrive, until the day no help arrives</p>
            <p>and then you're on your own.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>hoard matches, we aren't good</p>
            <p>at rubbing sticks together any more</p>
            <p>a tinder box is useful, if you can work it</p>
            <p>don't count on gas stove, gas heater</p>
            <p>electric light</p>
            <p>keep hibachi and charcoal, CHARCOAL STARTER a help</p>
            <p>kerosene lamp and candles, learn to keep warm</p>
            <p>with breathing</p>
            <p>remember the blessed American habit of bundling</p>

            <p>at some point</p>
            <p>you may be called upon</p>
            <p>to keep going for several days without sleep:</p>
            <p>keep some ups around, to be</p>
            <p>clearheaded, avoid 'comedown' as much as possible,</p>
            <p>take vitamin B along with amphetamines, try</p>
            <p>powdered guarana root, available</p>
            <p>at herb drugstores, it is an up</p>
            <p>used by Peruvian mountainfolk, tastes</p>
            <p>like mocha (bitter) can be put in tea</p>

            <p>keep you going past amphetamine wooziness</p>
            <br/>
            <p>at some point</p>
            <p>you may have to crash, under tension, keep some downs</p>
            <p>on hand, you may have to cool out</p>
            <p>sickness, or freak-out, or sorrow, keep some downs</p>
            <p>on hand, I don't mean</p>
            <p>tranquillizers, ye olde fashioned SLEEPING PILL</p>
            <p>(sleep heals heads, heals souls) chloryll hydrate</p>
            <p>(Mickey Finn) one of the best, but</p>
            <p>nembutal, etc. OK in a pinch, remember</p>
            <p>no liquor with barbiturates</p>
            <br/>
            <p>at some point</p>
            <p>you will need painkillers, darvon</p>
            <p>is glorified shit, stash some codeine & remember</p>
            <p>it's about five times more effective</p>
            <p>if taken with aspirin</p>
            <br/>
            <p>ups, downs & painkillers are</p>
            <p>the essence: antibiotics</p>
            <p>for extreme infections, any good</p>
            <p>wide-spectrum one will do, avoid penicillin</p>
            <p>too many allergies, speaking of which</p>
            <p>cortisone is good for really bad attacks</p>
            <p>(someone who freaks out asthma-style, or with hives)</p>
            <br/>
            <p>USE ALL THESE AS LITTLE</p>
            <p>as possible, side effects multifarious</p>
            <p>and they cloud the brain</p>
            <p>tend to weaken the body and obscure</p>
            <p>judgment</p>
            <br/>
            <p>ginseng tea, ginger compresses, sea salt,</p>
            <p>prayer and love</p>
            <p>are better healers, easier come by, save the others</p>

            <p>but don't get uptight: the guns</p>

            <p>an incidental part of the action</p>
            <p>which we better damn well be good at,</p>
