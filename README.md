>We return with the sea, the tides<br>
we return as often as leaves, as numerous<br>
as grass, gentle, insistent, we remember<br>
the way,<br>
our babes toddle barefoot thru the cities of the universe.

— from *Revolutionary Letter #4*

>avoid the folk<br>
who find Bonnie and Clyde too violent

— from *Revolutionary Letter #6*
